## Steph's Awesome Note Taker

In this application. The goal was to develop a front end and back end application that can take and save notes. For this app, the user can go to a home page that is generated by the server, go to the notes page, type in a note with a title and text, and then save that note. The user can then add in more notes that get pushed into the api/json link that can be viewed, all with random ID's. When the user refreshes the page, the saved notes still appear.
